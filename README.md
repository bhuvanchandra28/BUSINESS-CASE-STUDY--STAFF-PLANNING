# BUSINESS-CASE-STUDY--STAFF-PLANNING

The insurance approval process, i.e., underwriting is one of the important and time-consuming tasks in an insurance application processing. When you submit your insurance application, the underwriter of the company evaluates it based on the details that you provide using a rule-based or an ML model and decides whether or not to approve your application. You can refer to this link for a better understanding of the underwriting process though it is not pertinent to the case study.

 

An insurance company InsurePlus wants you to help them with finding the optimal number of staff that they need for their insurance application approval process for the calendar year 2021.  In the industry, the number of staffs is considered as a continuous variable. This is also called a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) of the staff. For example, if a full-time employee (FTE =1) works for 50 hours a week, 10 hours corresponds to 0.2 FTEs. If the pay for 50 hours a week is $5000, then 0.2 FTE who may be a part-time employee will be paid $1000 (5000*0.2). You can read about the concept of a full-time equivalent here. In this case study, you have been provided with the information that follows.
